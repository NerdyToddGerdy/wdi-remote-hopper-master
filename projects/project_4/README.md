# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #4: Ruby on Rails - Group Project

## Overview

For your 4th project, you will be collaborating to make an application using Ruby on Rails as the backend with an angular front end.
<br>
Use your imagination to find an app idea that you feel excited to build! Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**, but you'll have partners to help you carry the load.
## Project due date
**Tuesday, May 23**<br>
Submit an issue (as you normally do for homework) with a link to your repo AND a link to your live site. You will be presenting your projects in front of the class. The title for your issue should be `Your Names - Project 4`

## Attendance
You are required to be present at 10:00 am EDT each day during the project. We will be taking attendance - this will count for both morning and afternoon attendance.

## Standups
We will have student-run stand-ups each morning at 10:00 am EDT where you will answer the following questions:
- What did I work on yesterday
- What am I trying to get done today
- What is preventing me from getting this done.

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

## Meetings with instructors
_Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time_
Wednesday, May 17

Projects and groups are announced.
Meet to discuss your ideas with your teammate(s) and choose one idea (remember, you can always use other ideas for your next project(s)).
You will have a 15 minute meeting with an instructor in the afternoon to get your project approved.

Create a new Github repo OUTSIDE of your wdi-remote-hopper repository (more details with info about collaborating on a repo below).
Create your user stories and add them to your README.md.
Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals.
Make wireframes and add them to your README.md (or put images and add links).
Create your daily tracker.


**Thursday, May 18 - Monday, May 22**
15 minute meetings to check in with instructors. We will do things like check your wireframes, overall progress, and direct you to resources.

## Technical Requirements
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product


* **Rails backend:** Serve a JSON API with all CRUD operations available across your models (example: one model allows index and show, the other allows create, update, delete . The Rails API must be hosted.
* At least one **fully functional Angular front end app.** The frontend server must be hosted.
* **Configure CORS**, and your app, so that only the intended frontend app(s) can alter the database. Configure CORS so that anyone can read data from the hosted API.
* **AND *AT LEAST ONE* OF THE FOLLOWING:**
  * one-to-many relationship
  * many-to-many relationship
* A **working full-stack application, built by you & your group members**
* Two **git repositories hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
* At **least** one Github commit per day per member
* A **daily tracker** that all group members use (Trello, github issues, or another similar tracker)
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public via Heroku
* Have a **link to your hosted working app** in the `README.md` file in your github repo
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself/group members so you can come back to your project later and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc
* **Info filled out in the google sheet** - will be made available a day or two before the project due date


ALSO, don't forget: a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

  * Is ~5-10 minutes in length
  * All group members should speak during the presentation
  * Shows off all features of the app
  * Explains the technical details
  * Explains the technical challenges
  * Explains which improvements you might make
  
  
Additionally, we would like each group member to answer at least at least one of the following questions:
1) What went well for your group?
2) What was your groups biggest struggle?
3) What was the most useful tool that your group relied on the most
4) What was the most surprising aspect of working in a group/a thing (or things) you didn’t anticipate

  ---
### &#x1F535; Not mandatory:
#### Recommended features

* **third party API** with a gem
* authentication with [**Javascript Web Tokens**](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-remote-hopper/tree/master/unit_4/w11d04/instructor_notes)
* **[Versioned API](http://sourcey.com/building-the-prefect-rails-5-api-only-app/)**
* Authentication with [**API key**](http://sourcey.com/building-the-prefect-rails-5-api-only-app/)
* A **second front end app** using either jQuery, React, Vue, Swift, etc.
* A **second front end app for a mobile device** using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) or [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/next/)
* What about using **graphs or visuals** on your data? Chart.js , D3.js
* **Include portfolio-quality styling**
* **Use a CSS framework** like skeleton or bootstrap
* **Include User Stories**
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process (uploaded to your github repo)


### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).
* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.
* Create your **user stories**
* Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given 5 days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## Where to go for help during project week
1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help with our class TA
4. Submit a Github issue **on the wdi-remote-hopper** class Github account to receive help from an instructor. Note: You must do @your_instructors_github_handle, inside the comment area of your issue, to notify your instructor that you have created an issue.

## Formatting your GitHub Issue for the class repo to ask for help

*PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submitting an issue and linking us to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.*

1. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

2. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relevant code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
  - If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.

3. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.

4. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?
